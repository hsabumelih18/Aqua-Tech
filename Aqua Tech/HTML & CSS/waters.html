    <h3>Rivers</h3>

          <p> Asia has some of the largest rivers and lakes in the world. The three catchments of the three enclosed oceans are huge, and the island-free areas have the largest area compared to other continents.
       

            Some of the largest rivers in Asia flow into the Arctic Ocean. The Ob River (with its tributary the Irtysh River), the Yenisei River (along with its tributaries the Angara and the Selenga is the longest in the continent - 5940 km), the Lena River (4450 km) ) and the rivers Yana, Indigirka and Kolima. The Siberian rivers freeze for 6-7 months, and in the short summer they cause floods. Many rivers also flow into the Pacific Ocean: the Amur (4440 km), the cradle of the Chinese civilization Yellow River (Yellow River), the Yangtze River (5700 km) and the Mykong River, which flows into the South Sea with a delta. Irrawaddy, as well as the deepest Himalayan river-Ganges. Together with the river Bramaputra form the largest delta on Earth (80 thousand km2), as well as the Indus, Shat el Arab and others. In the equatorial parts of Asia, the rivers are short, but flooded all year round. In the non-drainage areas of the continent most rivers dry up. In the deserts are formed "sairi" - temporary rivers caused by rainfall.

        <h3>Lakes</h3>

        <p>
            Undoubtedly the largest lake on the continent is the Caspian Sea with an area of ​​over 370 thousand km2. It is the most extensive depression on the planet (28 m below sea level). In the north it is less salty because of the flowing river Volga. In the east is located the drained Aral Sea, which in recent years has reduced its area. The third largest is Baikal (32,500 km2), which represents 25% of the world's freshwater reserves. It is also the deepest in the world - 1637 m. 330 rivers flow into it, and only one flows - the Angara River. Shan is Lake Isak-Kul (warm lake), which is freshwater and runoff. North of it is another runoff lake-Balkhash (with an area of ​​over 18 thousand km2), which is known for the fact that half of it is salty, and the other is freshwater. In Asia there is also the very salty Dead Sea. Other lakes in the continent are Van, Rezaie, Sevan, Namzo and others.

        <h3>Economic significance and use of water:</h3>

        <p>
            The waters of the continent since ancient times have been used for various purposes - irrigation, shipping, fishing. Today, most large rivers are navigable. Rivers are also used to generate electricity - Asia has 1/3 of the world's water reserves. In some parts of the continent, large irrigation systems have been built. Salt is extracted from the lakes, and tourism is developed. A number of laws have been passed in Asia to protect water resources.
